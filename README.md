# Pray 4 Friends

Use this script to generate messages you can send to members of a small group so that they can pray for each other!

## Instructions

1. Place historical prayer data under the `prayer-history/` folder. This is so that people aren't praying for the same people too often.
2. Add the names of your people and their gender.
3. Add instructions on how they can find the other person's prayer.
4. Run the script using `python pray4friends.py` and read the output.

## Examples

After you follow all the instructions, you'll get a printed output for all the members of your small group like this:

```markdown
### Send this message to Joe Smith:

Hey, Joe! Hope you've been having a great week ðŸ™‚ Could you please pray for Johnny Cash at least once this week?

Please tell them you are praying for them!

You can find their prayer here:

Thank you for praying for your brothers and sisters! ðŸ™‚
```

God bless you!
